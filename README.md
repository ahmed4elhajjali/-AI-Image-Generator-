# 🖼️ Generative Image Creation (Diffusion-Based)

This project is a **generative image creation application** built on **diffusion-based modeling**, enabling the transformation of natural language descriptions into high-quality images through an iterative denoising process.

The main goal of this project is to **apply generative diffusion concepts in a practical, interactive system**, making them accessible for experimentation and learning.

## 🖥️ Application Flow

1. User provides a natural language description  
2. The system initializes random noise  
3. A diffusion-based process iteratively denoises the image  
4. The final image is generated and displayed
